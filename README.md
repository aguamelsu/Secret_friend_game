# Secret_friend_game

## Objective
- This script is part of the Oracle ONE Next Generation program. Intended to be a challenge to test my basic skills on JavaScript. 

## How it works?
- The game works by asking the user to input names of some of their friends. It also accounts for malicious input by alerting the user if no input is submitted.
- Once the user has finished listing all of their friends, the program "randomly" picks one of them and prints their name on the screen. 

## Personal notes:
### 30/07/25
- Today I started the project. I created a new repo via **git init**, added and commited the files, then connected it to github with **remote add** and finally pushed the files. 
- I'm not working on any feature today. Since its the first day of working on this challenge, I want to clearly determine a plan on how to approach each feature of the script, as well as starting to plan the structure I will use.  

## 31/07/25
- Today I finished the project. It took me around an hour to do so. The main obstacle I faced was that I didn't know how to add list elements to an ul with JS. I learned that first I had to access the UL as a "parent", and finally append the element as a "child" of the UL. This parent and child thing is kind of confusing for me. I haven't learned about OOP, but I hope to do so when I learn backend with JAVA. 
- This was an easy project. I was even able to add a new feature such as the new game button, which resets everything and lets the user play again. 
- I'm feeling more comfortable with JS syntax and its programming logic. One thing I noticed was that there is not like an "open" script if I could call it that way. It's more like a bunch of functions just waiting to be called by an event happenng on the HTML page. On python I was able to just print something and see the output straight away. On JS I'm able to do so by calling the "console.log", but it doesn't feel the same since it relies on having an HTML script.
- I'm proud of this project, and I hope I can eventually create more functional and complex projects as weeks go by and I keep learning.
