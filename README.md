# Secret_friend_game

## Objective
- This script is part of the Oracle ONE Next Generation program. Intended to be a challenge to test my basic skills on JavaScript. 

## How it works?
- The game works by asking the user to input names of some of their friends. It also accounts for malicious input by alerting the user if no input is submitted.
- Once the user has finished listing all of their friends, the program "randomly" picks one of them and prints their name on the screen. 

## Personal notes:
### 30/07/25
- Today I started the project. I created a new repo via **git init**, added and commited the files, then connected it to github with **remote add** and finally pushed the files. 
- I'm not working on any feature today. Since its the first day of working on this challenge, I want to clearly determine a plan on how to approach each feature of the script, as well as starting to plan the structure I will use.
